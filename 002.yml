# We define a mapping called default_settings. 
# This mapping is labeled with the anchor &default, allowing us to reference it later.

production_settings:
  <<: *default
  retries: 5
# In production_settings, we merge all key-value pairs from the default anchor using the merge key (<<). 
# It essentially "unpacks" the default_settings mapping at the top level of the production_settings mapping.
# We override the retries key with a new value, 5, while keeping the timeout value from the merged anchor.
